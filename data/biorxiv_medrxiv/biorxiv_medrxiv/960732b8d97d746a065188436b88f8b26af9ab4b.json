Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to 5 inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 relative to 6 the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral 7 replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to 8 type I interferon pretreatment.

            "text": "120Coupled with a novel furin cleavage site 25 , robust upper airway infection 8 , and potential 121 transmission prior to symptomatic disease 26 , the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-122CoV-2 could prove important in disrupting the ongoing spread of COVID-19. For SARS-CoV, in 123 vitro studies have consistently found that wild-type SARS-CoV is indifferent to type I IFN 124 pretreatment 27,28 . Similarly, in vivo SARS-CoV studies have found that the loss of type I IFN 125signaling had no significant impact on disease suggesting the virus controlled this pathway 29 . 126However, more recent reports suggest that host genetic background may majorly influence this 127 finding 30 . For SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that type I IFN pretreatment produces a 3 -4 128 log drop in viral titer. This level of sensitivity is similar to MERS-CoV and suggests the novel 129CoV lacks the same capacity to modulate a primed type I IFN response as SARS-CoV 31,32 . 130Notably, the sensitivity to type I IFN does not completely ablate viral replication; unlike SARS-131CoV 2'O methyl-transferase mutants 27 , SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate to low, detectable 132 levels even in the presence of type I IFN. This finding could help explain positive test in patients 133 with minimal symptoms and the range of disease observed. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 is 134 sensitive to type I IFN pretreatment, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV employ effective means 135 to disrupt recognition until late during infection 33 ; a similar mechanism may also be employed 136 by SARS-CoV, diminishing the overall effect of type I IFN during infection. 137For SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity to type I IFN indicates a distinction from SARS-CoV and 138suggests differential host immune modulation between the viruses. The loss of ORF3b and 139 truncation/changes in ORF6 could signal a reduced capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate type I 140 . For SARS-CoV ORF6, the N-terminal domain has been shown to have a clear 141 role in its ability to disrupt karyopherin transport 24 ; in turn, the loss of ORF6 function for SARS-142CoV-2 would likely render it much more susceptible to type I IFN pretreatment as activated 143STAT1 and other transcriptional factors would now have the capacity to enter the nucleus and 144 induce an interferon stimulated gene response. For SARS-CoV ORF3b, the viral protein has 145 been shown to disrupt phosphorylation of IRF3, a key transcriptional factor in the induction of an 146 antiviral state 23 . While its mechanism of action is not clear, the ORF3b absence in SARS-CoV-2 147 infection likely impacts its ability to control the type I IFN response. Similarly, while NSP3 148 deubiquitinating domain remains intact, SARS-CoV-2 has a 24 AA insertion upstream of this 149 deubiquitinating domain that could potentially alter that function 22 . Similarly, while other 150 antagonists are maintained with high levels of conservation (>90%), single point mutations in 151 key locations could modify function and contribute to increased IFN sensitivity. Overall, the 152 sequence analysis suggests that differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral 153 proteins may drive attenuation in the context of type I IFN pretreatment. 154 The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 suggests utility in treatment using type I IFN. 155 While type I IFN has been used in response to chronic viral infection 34 , previous examination of 156 SARS-CoV cases found inconclusive effect for type I IFN treatment 35 . However, the findings 157 from the SARS-CoV outbreak were complicated by combination therapy of type I IFN with other 158 treatments including ribavirin/steroids and lack of a regimented protocol. While type I IFN has 159 been utilized to treat MERS-CoV infected patients, no conclusive data yet exists to determine 160 efficacy 36 . Yet, in vivo studies with MERS-CoV has found that early induction with type I IFN 161can be protective in mice 37 ; importantly, the same study found that late type I IFN induction can 162 be detrimental for MERS-CoV disease 37 . Similarly, early reports have described treatments 163 using type I IFN in combination for SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet the efficacy of these treatments 164 and the parameters of their use is not known 38 . Overall, sensitivity data suggest that type I IFN 165",

Similarly, mouse models 171 for MERS-CV required adaptation in mice that had genetic modifications of their dipeptidyl-172 peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV 40,41 . However, each of these MERS-CoV 173 mouse models still retained full immune capacity. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to type I 174 IFN may signal the need to use an immune deficient model to develop relevant disease. While 175 initial work has suggested incompatibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice based on receptor 176 usage 8 , the type I IFN response may be a second major barrier that needs to be overcome. 177 Similar to the emergent Zika virus outbreak, the use of type I IFN receptor knockout mice or 178 type I IFN receptor blocking antibody may be necessary to develop auseful SARS-CoV-2 animal 179 models for therapeutic testing 42 . 180",

Standard plaque assays were used for 194 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 44,45 . All experiments involving infectious virus were conducted at 195 the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) in approved biosafety level 3 (BSL) 196 laboratories with routine medical monitoring of staff. 197 Infection and type I IFN pretreatment. Viral replication in Vero E6 were performed as 198 previously described 27,46 . Briefly, cells were washed with two times with PBS and inoculated 199 with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01 for 60 minutes at 37 200 \u00b0C. Following inoculation, cells were washed 3 times, and fresh media was added to signify time 201 0. Three or more biological replicates were harvested at each described time point and results 202 are from combination of two experiments. No blinding was used in any sample collections, nor 203 were samples randomized. For type I IFN pretreatment, experiments were completed as 204 previously described 27 . Briefly, Vero E6 cells were incubated with 1000 units/mL of 205 recombinant type I IFN alpha (PBL Assay Sciences) 18 hours prior to infection 27 . Cells were 206 infected as described above and type I IFN was not added back after infection. 207 Phylogenetic Tree and Sequence Identity Heat Map. Heat maps were constructed from a set 208 of representative group 2B coronaviruses by using alignment data paired with neighbor-joining 209 phylogenetic trees built in Geneious (v.9.1.5). Sequence identity was visualized using EvolView 210 (http://evolgenius.info/) and utilized SARS-CoV Urbani as the reference sequence. Tree shows 211 the degree of genetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV across a selected group 2B 212 coronaviruses 213 Statistical analysis.
