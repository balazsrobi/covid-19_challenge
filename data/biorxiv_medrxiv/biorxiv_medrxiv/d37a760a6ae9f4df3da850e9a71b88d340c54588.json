The rapid escalation of COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a World Health Organization (WHO)-declared public health emergency of international concern. The global total number of COVID-19 cases has been several times that of SARS, and the death toll has also exceeded that of SARS 1 . As the source area of COVID-19 epidemic, Wuhan has the majority of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Nowadays, information is spreading more rapidly and extensively than it was in 2003 when SARS broke out, which might exacerbate public fear, panic, and distress. Frontline health workers (HWs) were saving lives while encountering an increasing workload and risk of infection. In the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic, it was reported that infected HWs accounted for 29 percent of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients 2 . Also, quarantined frontline HWs might be facing potential social isolation, and unquarantined HWs experiencing social discrimination. Therefore, they are susceptible to complex emotional reactions and psychological distress 3 . Furthermore, the mental health problems of HWs would impair their attention, cognitive functioning, and clinical decision-making 4, 5 , consequently increase the occurrence of medical errors and incidents, and ultimately put patients at risk. It was also well known that acute stress in disasters could have a lasting effect on the overall wellbeing [6] [7] [8] . Hence, the mental health problems of HWs in COVID-19 epidemic have become an urgent public health concern.",

A cutoff score nomograms were formulated based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis using the R packages \"rms\", \"Hmisc\" and \"ggplot2\" in R 3.5.2 (http://www.r-project.org/). The performances of the nomograms were measured by Concordance statistics (C-statistics) and assessed by calibration curves. Bootstraps with 1000 resamples were applied to these activities. The higher C-statistics indicated better ability to distinguish HWs with different risks of three outcomes. We considered the risk screening models as a useful clinical tool particularly when the C-statistic is higher than 0.70 14 .",

Meanwhile, in line with the results of previous studies in the SARS isolation unit, we also found that HWs in isolation wards have a more pronounced risk of stress 23 . Those who had two or more children showed a higher risk of stress, probably owing to their heavier family responsibilities. To make matters worse, the majority of HWs are female (85.0 percent in this study), since a large number of studies have confirmed the plight of working women 19 . Priority consideration should be given to female HWs. In our study, the exercise habit was associated with a lower risk of anxiety symptoms, suggesting that physical activity helps alleviate psychological impact caused by catastrophic events. Nevertheless, only 857 (16.9 percent) participants had exercise habits, indicating that the importance of exercise should be highlighted among HWs in China.",

            "text": "Wuhan is the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic with the most numerous and concentrated infected cases. The rising numbers of cases and deaths, coupled with the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, might create and spread public fear, panic, and distress. HWs at Tongji Hospital, officially designated as \"the specific hospital for the treatment of severe patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan\", might be facing a serious psychological challenge.Our single-center, cross-sectional survey showed that 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. A study during Taiwan's SARS outbreak, which included 1257 HWs in 2003, showed 77.4 percent of HWs reported anxiety and worrying, and 74.2 percent of HWs reported depression. As well, a study involving 652 frontline medical staff showed that 68 percent of participants reported severe levels of job-related stress, and 57.0 percent were found to have experienced psychological distress during the Hong Kong SARS outbreak in 2003. Compared to the results of previous studies in SARS-affected hospitals 15 , the morbidity of depression and anxiety of HWs in this study was relatively lower, which may be related to the different measurements used in these studies and psychological protective measures implemented by Tongji Hospital's administrators responding to COVID-19 in the early stage. The management of Tongji Hospital was initially alert to the mental health problems that HWs might encounter, and therefore implemented a series of psychological protective measures. Hospital-based, department-based, and ward-based care provided by hospital and department administrators, and full coverage of all departments with protective measures for nosocomial infection were the common independent protective factors for acute stress, depression and anxiety. Although HWs are currently facing inconvenient transportation and shortage of safeguards, in this study, 83.6 percent of HWs were satisfied with sufficient logistical support and comfortable accommodations provided by Tongji Hospital, 79.5 percent were satisfied with the full coverage of all departments with based, and ward-based care provided by hospital administrators and department leaders. Furthermore, 83.0 percent of HWs were satisfied with reasonable work shift arrangement, which was an independent protective factor for acute stress and depression. The hospital's psychiatric team had also tried to support staff with relaxation techniques through online WeChat Balint group. However, only 5.0 percent of HWs joined in WeChat Balint group, suggesting that more psychosocial interventions and follow-up programs especially for the susceptible population need to be developed and promoted to reduce the perception of threats of COVID-19 among HWs. Among the sociodemographic characteristics, the common risk factors for acute stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms were female, with history of mental disorders, history of physiological chronic non-communicable diseases, and family members or relatives suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and years of working >10 years. Gender factors and concomitant chronic non-communicable diseases have already been widely discussed and a considerable number of studies have suggested that females and people with concomitant chronic non-communicable diseases have higher risk of depression, anxiety and psychological stress 16-18 . Meanwhile, our study showed the risk of anxiety, depression, and acute stress tended to increase with increasing years of work, probably because most HWs with shorter working years were single (70.0 percent of HWs with years of working <2 years are single), with less occupational exhaustion and family responsibilities. During the SARS period, 21.0 percent of the infected people were In this study, 158 (3.1 percent) HWs were diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and 70 of them (44.3 percent) had family members and relatives infected. In addition, 693 (15.1 percent) HWs were not infected themselves, but their relatives and family members were diagnosed or suspected of COVID-19. HWs had a significantly increased risk of depression once infected with the COVID-19 virus, and increased risks of anxiety, depression, and stress once their family members or relatives were infected with the COVID-19 virus. The results of the subgroup analyses provided more details and indicated that we should employ stratified psychological intervention strategies according to different risk levels of HWs. We should keep track of the mental status of those HWs who were confirmed or suspected patients themselves and who had confirmed or suspected patients in their families.",
