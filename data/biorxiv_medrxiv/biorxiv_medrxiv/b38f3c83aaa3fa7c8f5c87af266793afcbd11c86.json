Our model identified three key clinical features, i.e., lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), from a pool of more than 300 features. The clinical route is simple to check and can precisely and quickly assess the risk of death. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance. : medRxiv preprint",

Under this circumstance, novel approaches based on feature data to help clinicians to identify high-risk patients as early as possible, to improve the prognosis of patients and to reduce the mortality of critically ill patients, are highly demanded and are of clinical significance. In this study, we used XGBoost . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The significance of our work is three-fold. First, instead of merely providing the high-risk factors as the earlier published articles, the present study has provided a general operable formula to precisely and quickly quantify the risk of death, representing a significant progress in clinical practice. For example, for patients with SPO2 below 93%, the respiratory support therapy include intranasal catheterization of oxygen, oxygen supply through mask, high flow oxygen supply through nasal catheter, non-invasive ventilation support, invasive ventilation support, and ECMO. However, the routine sequential usage of the oxygen therapy usually leads to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects in severe patients. Significantly, our predictive model is likely to identify high-risk patients before irreversible lesions occur. By using appropriate respiratory support therapy as soon as possible, we may be able to completely improve the prognosis. Second, these three revealed key features can be conveniently collected by any hospital, thus helping bypass large streams of patients crowded in top-tier hospitals. As a result, our model can substantially alleviate the pressure caused by the shortage of medical resources and facilitates the forming of hierarchical medical care system of COVID-19. Third, the millisecond machine learning speed of the present model could improve the efficiency of frontline doctors in term of classifying the severity and predicting the fatal development trend, thereby greatly releasing the heavy work load of doctors.",

The hypothesis is supported by the results of clinical studies [2 6 ]. Moreover, lymphopenia is a common feature in the patients with COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality[Error! Reference source not found.]. The injured alveolar epithelial cells could induce the infiltration of lymphocytes, leading to a persistent lymphopenia as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did, given that they share the similar alveolar penetrating and antigen presenting cells (APC) impairing pathway [14, 15] . A biopsy study has provided strong evidence that the counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated [Error! Reference source not found.]. Also, Jing and colleagues reported the lymphopenia is mainly related to the decrease of CD 4+ and CD 8+ T cells [16] . Thus, it is likely that lymphocytes play distinct roles in COVID-19, which deserves further investigation.",

The working mechanism of the XGBoost-based machine learning model is that it is detailed with quantitatively sorting clinical features accordingly to their criticality, then sorting out revealed features, and giving the interpretable clinical route. Inspiringly, with the assistance of such a model, we have extracted merely three key clinical features from all the 300+ features,i.e., LDH, hs-CRP and lymphocyte, which can precisely predict the survival with more than 90% accuracy. These three indexes correspond to the most important factors such as cell injury, cellular immunity and inflammation in the pathophysiological progress of COVID-19.",
