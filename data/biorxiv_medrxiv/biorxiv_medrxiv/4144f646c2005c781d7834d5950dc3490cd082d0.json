There have been more than 100,000 confirmed cases of the Corona Virus Disease in the world, as of May 8, 2020 . According to the WHO, 16-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill with a 2-3% mortality rate. With the most recent estimated viral reproduction number (R0), the average number of other people that an infected individual will transmit the virus to in a completely non-immune population, stands at about 3.77 [1] , indicating that a rapid spread of the disease is imminent. Therefore, it is crucial to identify infected individuals as early as possible for quarantine and treatment procedures.",

The minimum frequency in the selection interval is threshold, and the interval of frequency statistics is five. 3) Background area filling.

Sensitivity measures the ratio of positives that are correctly discriminated. Specificity measures the ratio of negatives that are correctly discriminated. AUC is an index to measure the performance of the classifier. NPV was used to evaluate the algorithm for screening, and PPV was the probability of getting a disease when the diagnostic index is positive. Youden Index was the determining exponent of the optimal bound. F1 score was a measure of the accuracy of a binary model. Additionally, performance was evaluated with F-measure (F1) to compare the similarity and diversity of performance. Kappa value measures the agreement between the CNN model prediction and the clinical report.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

These patients are termed COVID-19 negative in the cohort. The other 79 cases were from the three hospitals with confirmed nucleic acid testing of SARS-COV-2, therefore termed COVID-19 positive. Two radiologists were asked to review the images and sketched 1,065 representative images (740 for COVID-19 negative and 325 for COVID-19 positive) for analysis (Figure 2 is shown as an example). These images were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. First, we randomly selected two or three images from all of the patients' images for training and the remaining images were used for internal validation. The model training was iterated for 15,000 times with a step size of 0.01. The training loss curve is shown inFigure 3A. To test the stability and generalization of the model, we then randomly selected 320 images (160 images from COVID-19 negative and 160 images from COVID-19 positive) to construct the model. The remaining images were used for external validation. The model training was also iterated for 15,000 times with a step size of 0.01. The training loss curve is shown in",
