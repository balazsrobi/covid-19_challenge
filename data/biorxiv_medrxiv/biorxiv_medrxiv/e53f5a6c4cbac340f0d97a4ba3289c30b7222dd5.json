However, with the import of supportive fMW from other regions of China, the work duration of fMW may be decreased. By comparison, the non-fMW worked in a relatively mild environment and had less possibility of being infected, thus having less sleep disturbances. Our study also found that scores of PSQI among female fMW were significantly higher than that of male fMW although other scores showed no significant difference, which indicated that female fMW had worse sleep quality than male fMW in emergent events of public health. It is in accordance with previous studies [13, 44] . In a meta-analysis, Zhang et al [45] . calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female versus male toward insomnia. In general, females had inferior symptom bearing and more bodily vigilance, and the social culture encouraged females to express the indisposition more [46] , which potentially exaggerated the severity and prevalence of sleep disturbances. In addition, females tended to report more sleep problems even if having a similar degree of morning awakening compared to males [45] .",

Workload has increased dramatically for Chinese physicians, which exerted a trend that potentially threatened physicians' health and quality of patient care [34]. The prevalence of sleep disturbances in Chinese medical workers was 12.9%-78% [13, 40, 41]. The present study showed that over 50% of fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 had sleep disturbances. Although it is even higher than that of in normal times, the prevalence is still compatible to previous results from China. The high prevalence of sleep disturbances of fMW in battle with COVID-19 should be put much emphasize. It was reported that sleep characteristics may exert critical effects on immune functions, which may increase the inflammatory response to sleep deprivation and exert negative feedback to aggravate the short sleep duration and increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disorders [42].

The rapid spread of COVID-19 boomed the medical demands, aggravated the shortage of medical resources and increased work stress for fMW, especially for those with continuous working and frequent day-night shifts. And in terms of factors influencing sleep quality, severity of COVID-19, frequent work shiftsand work stress were the leading factors according to our study. We further found anxiety, depression were significantly correlated with PSQI and AIS in fMV, which indicated that anxious and depressive symptoms may influence sleep quality of fMW.The result was consistent with previous studies demonstrating that anxiety and depression played a key role in the development of sleep disturbances[43].

And compared to male fMW group, the female fMW group had significantly in China demonstrated that civil servants had the shortest sleep duration (Mean 7.85 hours) and the worst sleep equality, who may experience with more work pressure [21]. Meanwhile, 64.1% of police officers had PSQI > 5 points, and were regarded as sleep disturbances as reported. Their sleep disturbances were related to posttraumatic stress and general psychopathology [29]. A survey from Japan indicated that high occupational stress was significantly associated with insomnia, especially the presence of high efforts but low reward [30]. And exposure to long working hours and irregular work shifts may attribute to stress, fatigue and chronic diseases [31], which may influence the quantity and quality of sleep [32, 33]. Schiller et al.[28] compared sleep quality and sleep duration between full worktime subjects and 75% reduced worktime subjects, and found the latter presented with improved sleep quality and sleep duration. The reduction of worktime may be useful for alleviating sleep disturbances. Accompanied with long working hours, frequent day-night shifts, excessive workload and high stress, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances or sleep deprivation all over the world [20, 34].
