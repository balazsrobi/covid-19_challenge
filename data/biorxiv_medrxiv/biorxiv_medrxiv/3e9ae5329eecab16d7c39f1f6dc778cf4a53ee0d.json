From the age distribution, the results showed that there were 56.44% cases (57/101) whose age over 70 years (31 cases in 70-79y; 20 cases in 80-89y; and 6 cases in more than 90y). The median duration from hospital admission to death was 4 days (IQR, 2-7d). The most common symptoms were fever (82 cases [81.19%]), dyspnea (59 cases [58.42%]), dry cough (56 cases [55.45%]), fatigue (36 cases [35.64%]), expectoration (21 cases [20.79%]) and diarrhea (10 cases [9.90%]). Other less common symptoms were anorexia, myalgia, abdominal pain and distension, headache, nausea and vomiting, pharyngalgia, haematemesis and melena, hemoptysis.
