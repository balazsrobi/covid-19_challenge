So, there are rising concerns about community infections. Vaccination is one of the 29 most effective tools to prevent infectious diseases [1] [2]. As far as our knowledge concerns, there is no 30 report about developing COVID-19 multi epitope vaccine. Therefore, we became eager to design potent 31 multiepitope vaccines from antigenic sites of coronavirus surface glycoprotein. The multiepitope 32 vaccines have advantageous over conventional vaccines with regards to safety profile and high 33 immunogenicity [3] . Multiepitope vaccines have the potential to induce responses restricted by a 34 wide variety of HLA molecules and generate a balanced CD4+ and CD8+ cellular immune 35 response. Another molecule that contribute to innate immunity contains TLR3 that activates Escherichia coli [7] , Vibrio cholera [8], Human immunodeficiency virus-1 [9], Hepatitis C virus 43 [10] and many others. In several experimental studies, the efficacy of computationally designed 44 vaccines has been recently approved for use in defined human vaccines [11] [13] . In this study, in 45 silico analysis were performed to determine exclusive B cell and T-cell epitopes from coronavirus 46 surface glycoprotein that are antigenically most significant for coronavirus. In our research, some 47 unique exclusive B cell and T-cell epitopes from coronavirus surface glycoprotein were selected 48 based on their antigenicity, stability and length. The selected epitopes were merged into each other 49 using suitable linkers for organization of final vaccine construct. Consequently, the stability and 50 efficacy of the vaccines were predicted by a set of bioinformatics methods. the conserved sequence and antigenic peptide were selected for further analysis.

Human 117 IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOTPRO kits from Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden were used to quantify the frequency of 118 epitope-specific IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells in PBMCs. PBMCs (10 6 ) of each healthy donor were incubated 119 with each of the synthetic epitopes in ELISPOT plates. The epitope-specific CD4+ T cell responses were 120 determined after 24 hours. Each spot-forming unit (SFU) corresponds to one IFN\u03b3-secreting T cell. Results121are expressed as numbers of SFU per 10 6 PBMC. The negative control was PBMCs in medium without 122 epitope stimulation and was used to evaluate the spontaneous secretion of IFN\u03b3. The positive control was 123 polyclonal activator anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, which determine T cell numbers and viability of the 124 immunoassay. Initially, coronavirus surface glycoprotein was studied for determining specific conserved part of protein 129between the virus serotypes. Results of protein BLAST are shown inTable 1. The results demonstrated 130 that coronavirus surface glycoprotein had the most conservancy levels between 97. 8 and 100. Also, 131",

Though, with the development of computational methods, these limitations are reduced. 171 By the way, using computational methods, the design of recombinant vaccines and the estimation of 172 physicochemical properties as well as vaccines efficacy could be available [20] [21]. Then, this research 173 was intended to design an effective multi-epitope recombinant vaccine against coronavirus using a unique 174 multi-step bioinformatics approach. Our potent multi-epitope vaccine is contained seventeen epitopes in 175 surface glycoprotein of coronavirus along with AAY and KK linkers and 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as 176 adjuvant. Based on our knowledge, there is no report about computational design of epitope-based vaccine 177 for coronavirus. Recently, in silico, design of epitope-based vaccine was used for vaccine development 178 against several infectious diseases. Several bioinformatics tools have been established that accelerate the 179 growth of multi epitope-based vaccines. In recent decade, several multiepitope vaccines for pathogenic 180 viruses have been reported. Multi epitope vaccines could provide an effective immunization against 181 different serotypes of a pathogen. Despite mentioned advantages of Multi epitope vaccines, poor 182 immunogenicity is considered as a major drawback to growth of these vaccines [22], [23]. The in-silico 183",
