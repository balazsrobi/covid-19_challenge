Patients who are older (\u226560 years) or carry comorbidities of disorders (69.57% vs 11.29%, p<0.001), especially hypertension (39.13% vs 12.90%, p=0.0007) or Coronary heart disease (21.74% vs 4.84%, p=0.018) are more easily developed ARF. Dynamic survey in five COVID-19 patients showed that the perished cases have a rapid eGFR decline, but the concentrations of plasma creatinine and urea rapidly rose during disease progression. On the other hand, gradual recovery of eGFR was observed in convalescent patients, whose plasma creatinine and urea concentrations were low throughout the observation period (Figure 1) , suggesting ARF is a risk factor result in perish during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Varying degrees of acute tubular necrosis, luminal brush border sloughing and vacuole degeneration, was found in different areas of all six renal specimens. Severe infiltration of lymphocytes in tubulointerstitium was only observed in one patient who carries comorbidities of hypertension (>10 years) and coronary disease (>10 year). While minimal infiltration was seen in three cases who are comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and gout, and the other two cases are absence tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration, moreover, no obvious lymphocytes were seen in glomeruli, suggesting lymphocyte infiltration is uncommon after viral infection. At the same time, dilated capillary vessels were observed in the glomeruli of 6 cases, benign hypertensive glomerulosclerosis and autolysis were only noted in three cases who have coexisting hypertension, whereas, severe glomerular injury was absence in all of these six cases ( Figure 2, Table 2) .

This phenomenon is different from the 2003 outbreak SARS, which ARF was uncommon even though it was one of the top risk factors of mortality. 15 Patient who are aged or have comorbidities more commonly developed ARF, suggesting that these patients should be more closely examined to prevent ARF onset. We also summarized the dynamic eGFR from 5 COVID-9 patients who have long-term observation, and found that the perished cases manifested rapid decline in eGFR, and a rapid increase of the plasma creatinine and urea concentrations, with the levels peaking prior to death. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR level but persistent low levels of plasma creatinine and urea were observed in recovered patients who were treated with diuretics, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 mediated ARF may be one of the major causes of multiorgan failure and eventual death in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we strongly suggest that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney function in COVID-19 patients, particular for ARF cases, maybe a key method to preventing fatality.",

The infiltration of immune cells was not obvious except in one patient, indicating that acute renal damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 is independent of immune-mediated injury (Figure 2) . It has been shown that the ACE-2 receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is highly expressed in renal tubules. 12, 16 We used immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of viral NP antigen in situ in kidney tissues, and found that viral NP antigen was restricted to the renal tubular cells of the infected tissues. Our results strongly suggest that renal tubular injury is directly caused by viral infection and replication because SARS-CoV-2 is a cytopathic virus. This phenomenon is consistent with its other similarities to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which can also infect human kidney. 17, 18 Recently, some researcher reported they have successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles from urine of COVID-19 patients, and together with our study demonstrate that the kidney is also the site of viral infection and replication outside of the lungs, suggesting that kidney-originated viral particles may enter the urine through glomerular filtration.",

Kidney tissues from six other patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Among these 85 COVID-19 cases, 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF), and elder patients (\u2265 60 years old) are easier to develop ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001). Comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001). Dynamic observation of eGFR revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of eGFR but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment.
