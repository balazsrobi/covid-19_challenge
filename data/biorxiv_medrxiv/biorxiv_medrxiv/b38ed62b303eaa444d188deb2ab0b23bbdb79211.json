No approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-nCoV or any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.",

Vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also resulted in hypersensitivity and immunopathologic responses in mice [9, 7] . The diversity among coronavirus strains presents another challenge [9, 1] , as there are at least 6 distinct subgroups in the coronavirus genus. And while SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV share the same subgroup (2b), their genomes are only 77% identical [4] . Understanding the shared and unique epitopes of 2019-nCoV will help the field design better vaccines or diagnostic tests for patients. (ORFs) .

Negative peptides for CD8 T-cell epitopes are all 9mer sliding windows of S protein without a reported epitope. Negative peptides for CD4 T-cell epitopes are experimentally tested. A) NetMHCpan4 has a sensitivity of 82.3% and specificity of 97.0% with a 98th presentation percentile cut-off, and an overall AUC of 0.98. B) MARIA has a sensitivity of 66.6% and specificity of 91.1% with a 95th presentation percentile cut-off, and an overall AUC of 0.83. independent experimental studies [22, 23, 24, 25] , we identified known CD8 T-cell epitopes (MHC-I, n=17) and known CD4 T-cell epitopes (MHC-II, n=3). We also obtained known non-epitopes (n=1236 and 246) for CD4, while for CD8 we include all 9mer sliding windows of S protein without a known epitope as non-epitopes. MHC-I presentation (with recommended cut-off 98% [17] ) has a sensitivity of 82.3%, specificity of 97.0% and an AUC of 0.98 (Fig. 3A) . MHC-II presentation (recommended cut-off 95% [15] ) has a sensitivity of 66.6%, specificity of 91.1% and an AUC of 0.83 (Fig. 3B) .",

With computational protein-protein docking, we predicted one potential interacting conformation between the 2019-nCoV S protein and the human ACE2 entry receptor (Fig. 5C) . The main antibody binding site substantially overlaps with the interacting surface where ACE2 binds to S protein, and an antibody binding to this surface is likely to block viral entry into cells. Discotope2 identified anther antibody binding site (residue 246-257) different from SARS-CoV but with lower scores (>-2.5 raw scores). 3D structures of both spike protein were scanned with Discotope2 to assess potential antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes). Red indicates residues with score > 0.5 (cut-off for specificity of 90%), and pink indicates residues with score > -2.5 (cut-off for specificity of 80%). A) The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS spike protein has concentrated high score residues and is comprised of two linear epitopes. One additional binding site is predicted to be around residue 541-555. Three independent experimental studies [32, 30, 31] identify patient antibodies recognize these three linear epitopes (blue). B) 2019-nCoV spike protein is predicted to have a similar strong antibody binding site near RBD and an additional site around residue 246-257. C) The predicted antibody binding site on 2019-nCov RBD potentially overlaps with the interacting surface for the known human entry receptor ACE2 (yellow). D) Eight 2019-nCoV spike protein point mutations are present in a cohort of 68 viral samples. No mutations are near the ACE2 interacting surface. One mutation (S247R) occurs near one of the predicted antibody binding sites (residue 246-257). Table 2 : Top potential epitopes for key 2019-nCoV proteins. We ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. S protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on MHC presentation and is also one of the predicted top B-cell epitopes, localized near the S protein receptor binding domain ( Figure 5 ). MHC-I coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest MHC-I coverage for each epitope (highlighted in orange). All candidates are likely to be presented by both MHC-I and MHC-II.

A recent Cryo-EM study of 2019-nCoV S protein [18] supports such structural similarity, and it would be informative to rerun our analysis once the Cryo-EM crystal structure becomes publicly available. RBDs in both proteins seem to be important B-cell epitopes for neutralizing antibodies, however, SARS-CoV appears to have larger attack surface than 2019-nCoV (Fig. 5A, 5B) . Fortunately, we have not observed any mutations altering binding sites for this major B-cell epitope in 2019-nCoV.",

We validated our methodology by running a similar analysis on SARS-CoV against known SARS T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Inspecting 68 samples, we found that viral mutations have a tendency to occur in regions with strong MHC-I presentation, which can be a form of immune evasion. However, no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain which is critical for viral entrance to cells and neutralizing antibody binding.",
