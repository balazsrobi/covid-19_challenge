            "text": "2.89-4.39) in the early phase of the outbreak [10] . Very similar estimates, 2.2 (95% CI: 27 1.4-3.9), were obtained for R 0 at the early stages of the epidemic by Imai et al. 2.6 (95% 28 CI: 1.5-3.5) [11] , as well as by Li weeks [12] . Amidst such an important ongoing public health crisis that also has severe 33 economic repercussions, we reverted to mathematical modelling that can shed light to 34 essential epidemiologic parameters that determine the fate of the epidemic [13] . Here, 35 we present the results of the analysis of time series of epidemiological data available in 36 the public domain [14] [15] [16] (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) from January 11 to 37 February 10, 2020, and attempt a three-week forecast of the spreading dynamics of the 38 emerged coronavirus epidemic in the epicenter in mainland China. 39 Methodology 40 Our analysis was based on the publicly available data of the new confirmed daily cases 41 reported for the Hubei province from the 11th of January until the 10th of 42 February [14] [15] [16] . Based on the released data, we attempted to estimate the mean 43 values of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number R 0 , 44 the case fatality (hat\u03b3) and case recovery (\u03b2) ratios, along with their 90% confidence 45 intervals. However, as suggested [17] , the number of infected, and consequently the 46 number of recovered, people is likely to be much higher. Thus, in a second scenario, we 47 have also derived results by taking twenty times the number of reported cases for the number of deaths that is more likely to be closer to the real number. Furthermore, by 50 calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported data, we also provide 51 tentative forecasts until the 29th of February. 52 The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is one of the key values that can predict 53 whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out. R 0 represents 54 the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single 55 infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectiousness period. 56 Based on the reported data of confirmed cases, we provide estimations of the R 0 from 57 the 16th up to the 20th of January in order to satisfy as much as possible the 58 hypothesis of S \u2248 N that is a necessary condition for the computation of R 0 . 59 We also provide estimations of the case fatality (\u03b3) and case recovery (hat\u03b2) ratios 60 over the entire period using a rolling window of one day from the 11th of January to the 61 16th of January to provide the very first estimations. 62 Furthermore, we calibrated the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported 63 data. We first provide a coarse estimation of the recovery (\u03b2) and mortality rates (\u03b3) of 64 the SIRD model using the first period of the outbreak. Then, an estimation of the 65 infection rate is accomplished by \"wrapping\" around the SIRD simulator an 66 optimization algorithm to fit the reported data from the 11th of January to the 10th of 67 February. We have start our simulations with one infected person on the 16th of 68 November, which has been suggested as a starting date of the epidemic, run the SIR 69 model until the 10th of February . Below, we describe analytically our approach. 70 Let us start by denoting with S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t), the number of susceptible, 71 infected, recovered and dead persons respectively at time t in the population of size N . 72 For our analysis, we assume that the total number of the population remains constant. 73 Based on the demographic data for the province of Hubei N = 59m. Thus, the discrete 74 SIRD model reads:",

Hence, for \u03b3 we have taken the interval (0.008 and 0.012) and for \u03b2, 215 we have taken the interval between (0.05 0.076) corresponding to recovery periods from 216 13 to 20 days.

These numbers 321 are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of 322 February that are based on Scenario I. In Scenario II, by assuming a 20-fold scaling of 323 the confirmed cases of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number 324 of the recovered cases in the total population, forecasts show a significant decline of 325 outbreak in Hubei by 29th of February. This fact has been lately reported. Based on 326 this scenario the casefatality rate in the total population is of the order of \u223c0.15%. At 327 this point we should note that our SIRD modelling approach did not take into account 328 many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the 329 effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact 330 transmission network, the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, 331 the characteristics of the population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already 332 health problems). Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an 333 assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and 334 reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from 335 person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of 336 the fecal-oral route [21] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before 337 the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected 338 unknown numbers of people. The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with 339 subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may 340 be substantial; these cases, which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 341 infections, remain unrecognized, especially during the influenza season [22] . This highly 342 likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases 343 inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context, 344 distorting epidemiologic reality. Another important factor that should be taken into 345 consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and 346 confirm cases. A positive PCR test was required to be considered a confirmed case by 347 China's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment program in the early 348 phase of the outbreak [14] . However, the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel 349 viral pathogen may only be 30-50%, thereby often resulting in false negatives, 350 particularly early in the course of illness. To complicate matters further, the guidance 351 changed in the recently-released fourth edition of the program on February 6 to allow 352 March 5, 2020 24/28 .

The swiftly 353 growing epidemic seems to be overwhelming even for the highly efficient Chinese 354 logistics that did manage to build two new hospitals in record time to treat infected 355 patients. Supportive care with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 356 intensive care units (ICUs) is critical for severe respiratory disease. Large-scale 357 capacities for such level of medical care in Hubei province, or elsewhere in the world for 358 that matter, amidst this public health emergency may prove particularly challenging. 359 We hope that the results of our analysis contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects 360 of this outbreak so as to contain the novel coronavirus as soon as possible and mitigate 361 its effects regionally, in mainland China, and internationally.",
