            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is the controlled slippage of the translating ribosome to an alternative frame. This tightly regulated process is widely employed by human viruses such as HIV and SARS-CoV and is critical for their life cycle and virulence. It is also utilized throughout the tree of life to implement a feedback control mechanism to regulate polyamine levels. However, despite its universality and clinical relevance, a limited number of studies investigated this process on only a few selected examples, largely due to a lack of experimental means. Here, we developed a highthroughput, fluorescence-based approach to assay the frameshifting potential of a sequence. We designed and tested >12.000 sequences based on 15 viral and human frameshifting events, allowing us to elucidate the rules governing ribosomal frameshifting in a systematic way and to discover novel regulatory features. We also utilized our approach to search for novel frameshifting events and identified dozens of previously unknown frameshifting sites in human, showing that programmed ribosomal frameshifting is more common than previously anticipated. We assessed the natural variation in HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates by testing >500 clinical isolates and identified subtypespecific differences as well as associations between viral load in patients and the optimality of gagpol frameshifting rates. We further devised a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts frameshifting rates of novel variants (up to r=0.70), including subtle differences between HIV isolates (r=0.44), providing a basis for the development of antiviral agents acting on programmed ribosomal frameshifting. author/funder.

            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), i.e. controlled slippage of the ribosome, is a mechanism by which two proteins with alternative C termini can be generated from the same mRNA. It allows for an expansion of the proteome but also constitutes an additional regulatory layer to fine-tune gene expression (Advani and Dinman, 2016; Dinman, 2012; Ketteler, 2012) . This mechanism is widespread and indispensable in viruses, which often utilize controlled slippage of the ribosome to an alternative frame to regulate the production of key enzymes, such as in the case of the gag-pol frameshift in HIV and other retroviruses. This is a strikingly robust and precise process with minimal variability (Dulude et al., 2006; Hung et al., 1998) , which might explain why viruses rely on it rather than other means of posttranscriptional and translational control for crucial regulatory switches. The importance of maintaining the stoichiometry between structural proteins encoded by the gag gene and enzymes encoded by the pol gene for viral replicative success make the gag-pol frameshifting event a promising antiviral drug target (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; Hung et al., 1998) .",

Discovering PRF events in the human genome has been hampered by the limited amenability of PRF to proteome-wide methods due to the generally low abundance of the frameshifted protein relative to the canonical protein or inherent instability of the frameshifting product. Most human cases known to date were found serendipitously or through homologous genes. A striking example of regulatory conservation is the case of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ), which is produced through polyamine-stimulated +1 frameshifting and inhibits polyamine production (Kurian et al., 2011; Matsufuji et al., 1995) . This negative feedback loop is used by virtually all organisms from yeast to humans to control polyamine levels (Ivanov et al., 2000) , attesting to the evolutionary success of PRF as a regulatory mechanism.",

Most presently known -1 slippery sites follow the pattern XXXYYYZ, with the shift happening from codon YYZ to YYY. Some known slippery sites show more or less extensive divergence from this pattern, and especially at +1 frameshifting sites like OAZ ribosomal translocation happens at a very distinct motif (UCCUGA). Many case studies have contributed to an understanding of the molecular events happening during frameshifting (e.g. Belew et al., 2014; Caliskan et al., 2015; Kurian et al., 2011; Ritchie et al., 2017; Tholstrup et al., 2012) , but the general, overarching regulatory principles that determine if and to what extent PRF happens and the prevalence of the process in eukaryotes remain largely unknown.",

GFP would only be made into protein if the corresponding frameshift occurred, and GFP fluorescence intensity thus serves as a measure for frameshifting efficiency. We introduced this construct in the AAVS1 locus in the human K562 cell line using zinc finger nucleases, such that every cell has one frameshifting reporter construct from the library and all the variants have the same genomic environment (Methods). For both, the -1 and +1 reporter libraries, we sorted the mCherry-positive population corresponding to a single integration of the reporter transgene using flow cytometry into 16 bins according to their GFP fluorescence intensity and sequenced genomic DNA from all the bins to unravel the distribution of each variant. We previously demonstrated that similar approaches are highly accurate and reproducible (Mikl et al., 2018; Vainberg Slutskin et al., 2018; Weingarten-Gabbay et al., 2016) , and the bin profiles for barcode control groups with identical variable region ( Fig S1A) corroborate the low technical noise we are able to achieve. Moreover, by measuring GFP fluorescence of our reporter construct containing the human OAZ1 frameshifting site in the presence of different levels of spermidine we confirmed that we were able to detect the previously reported sensitivity to polyamine levels (Kurian et al., 2011) using our FACS-based reporter assay ( Fig S1B) . author/funder.

Additional requirements for frameshifting (like the presence of a specific miRNA as in the case of CCR5 (Belew et al., 2014) ) can explain the lack of signal for some of the cases. Most single point mutations within the slippery sequence abrogated frameshifting and resulted in green fluorescence at background levels, both for -1 and +1 frameshifting sites ( Fig 1CD, Fig S2B) , demonstrating that we indeed measure frameshifting at the expected site. Notably, a cytosine in position 4 in the canonical slippery site XXXYYYZalthough disrupting the decoding compatibility between the source and the target codondid not interfere with PRF in three out of five cases ( Fig   S2C) , against the na\u00efve assumption that identity in the first position in the codon at which the shift to the -1 frame happens would be critical for the efficiency of the process. Replacing the slippery sequence in our set of -1 PRF events with all possible variations of the pattern XXXYYYZ revealed preferences for specific combinations common in known PRF sites, like UUUUUUZ (HIV, SIVmac239) and XXXAAAC (HERV-K10, HTLV, PEG10, SARS), but no general inhibition of PRF by the presence of a specific base at any of the three positions ( Fig S2D) .",

Using our comprehensive assay we observed that -1 slippery sites generally lack the ability to frameshift in the 3' direction (and therefore do not give a signal in the +1 frame), whereas +1 slippery sites do have the ability to induce -1 frameshifting ( Fig 1E) . Strikingly, this includes the OAZ1 frameshifting site, which is fundamentally different from all known -1 PRF slippery sites. Native OAZ1 has several stop codons in the -1 frame downstream of the frameshifting site and -1 frameshifted versions can therefore not be detected in our assay, but specific combinations of upstream and downstream native sequences from other frameshifting sites (and lacking stop codons in the -1 frame) have the ability to drive -1 frameshifting at the native OAZ1 slippery site ( Fig S2E) .

            "text": "While previous investigations of frameshifting focused on individual examples, we aimed to identify commonalities and differences between frameshifting sites. While mutations in the slippery site and the downstream region have a negative effect on frameshifting efficiency across contexts, changes in the upstream region tend to lead to higher -1 frameshifting rates (between 9.5% and 45.9% mean increase compared to wild-type frameshifting rates for different PRF events, Fig 2A; p-values per position (Mann-Whitney U test) shown in Fig S4A) . This suggests that inhibitory signals upstream of the frameshifting site as found for SARS (Su et al., 2005) could be a widespread property of PRF sites, probably creating a balance to ensure that frameshift promoting signals like a rigid downstream secondary structure don't lead to a complete inhibition of translation and potentially degradation of the mRNA. In contrast to the other -1 PRF events assayed, the native region upstream (but not downstream) of the HTLV PRF site enhances frameshifting. Consequently, changes in the upstream region in general (Fig 2A, Fig S4A, mean decrease of 23% compared to wild-type frameshifting rates) and recoding or manipulating the secondary structure of the upstream region ( Fig 2B, mean decrease of 58.9% compared to wild-type frameshifting rates, p<5*10 -4 ) had strong negative effects on the downstream PRF event. While the upstream region of OAZ1 is thought to harbor positive signals (cf. Ivanov et al., 2006) , which we find to be located in the 20 nucleotides before the slippery site ( Fig 2C, decrease of PRF activity to 31.3% of wild-type PRF rate, p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, effect on region further upstream not significant), HIV frameshifting rates show an increase upon mutation of the corresponding upstream region (Fig 2BC, mean increase of PRF activity to 128.2% of wild-type rates, p<0.007, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, effect on region further upstream not significant).",

In contrast, the first codon downstream of the secondary site showed purely DNA sequence, but not amino acid-specific effects (Fig S4G, exemplified by the differences between the Proline codons CCA, CCC and CCG). We further examined the influence of decoding efficiency as measured by the tRNA adaptation index (tAI) on PRF and found that the tAI of the codon at which the translocation happens is positively correlated with PRF efficiency (Fig 2I) , indicating that decoding efficiency at the shifting codon is not contributing to stalling of the ribosome.",

Using mass spectrometry we detected peptides covering most of frame 0 and frame -1 after the frameshifting site, with peptides coming from multiple variants (Fig S6A) . Frameshifting rates of the variants are distributed around the rate observed for the lab wild-type strain HXB2 (Fig 4A) . This constitutes actual differences in frameshifting rates and not only experimental variability, as isolated clones show remarkably good correlation given the small differences in PRF rates we are measuring (Fig 4B) . Secondary structure showed the best correlation with frameshifting rates when considering the first 40 nucleotides after the frameshifting site (Fig S6B) , matching the region of high sequence conservation (Fig S6A) . We grouped the HIV variants based on subtype and found significant differences between the groups (Fig 4C, p<3 *10 -5 , one-way ANOVA), most notably higher frameshifting rates in subtype C (p<0.006 for the difference between C and B). HIV subtypes show distinct geographical distributions (Hemelaar et al., 2006) , and consequently we also observed differences between countries of origin (Fig S6C, p<0.002 ), but no change in frameshifting rates over time (Fig S6D, p=0.8) .",
